// FileOutputStream is used to write binary data to a file (text, audio, images, etc), can also use FileWriter that writes 2 charachers at a time, but not used
/*
    The getBytes() method is called on the msg string to convert it into a byte array b. This is necessary because the write() method of FileOutputStream requires a byte array as its input.
